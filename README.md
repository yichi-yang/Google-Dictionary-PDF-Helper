# Google Dictionary PDF Helper #
An AHK script that searches the selected text using Google Dictionary Chrome extension when the hotkey is pressed, even works on a PDF page.  

Hotkey: `shift + z` (edit the script to customize)  

Note: You have to make the dictionary extension icon **visible** to use the script. The script uses the [ImageSearchMake](https://autohotkey.com/docs/commands/ImageSearch.htm) function to find the icon. Make a screenshot of the icon starting from its center to bottom right corner, rename it 'google_dict.png' and place it in the same folder as the script.
